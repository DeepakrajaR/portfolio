            <p>
              I'm an AI/ML Engineer passionate about creating intelligent systems that solve complex problems. With
              expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data science, I develop solutions that transform raw
              data into actionable insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work focuses on building scalable AI systems that can be deployed in production environments. I have
              experience with various frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, as well as cloud
              platforms like AWS and Google Cloud.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest research papers, contributing to open-source
              projects, or sharing knowledge through technical writing and presentations.
